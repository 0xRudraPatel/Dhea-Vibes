                                        Born and brought up in Mumbai. Part of a loving close-knit family which has always supported me in following my passion and has applauded my growth at every step.
                                        I developed keen interest and made my way towards astrology 3 years ago and I qualify in many aspects of astrology like Tarot, Vedic Numerology, Runes, Zibu symbols, Pendulum Dowsing, Vedic and KP astrology, Vedic switchwords, Vedic Mantras and healing practices like Reiki.
                                        Always I felt myself drawn to people, counsel them and help solve their problems. With astrology as a tool, it feels more enlightened and it’s a logical and disciplined way to solve the problems with proven and experienced remedies which are scientific and not involving great efforts. 
                                        
                                        My clients have benefited a lot with my astrological knowledge and are deeply satisfied with the results. They count on me in getting guidance for all important decisions.
                                        
                                        I believe in serving the society with dedication, helping out clients most sincerely and building strong connections by being just a call away to help them in every possible way in every given situation.
                                        
                                        I have gained considerable experience which has given me abundant confidence in helping out my clients. In this journey I am immensely thankful to my mentors who have taught and have been guiding me still. It’s because of my teachers that I was able to identify and find my path. I am fortunate to find such mentors who have ancient knowledge and know contemporary ways too.</p>

                            <p>Astrology is an ancient divination tool that has been used for centuries to gain insight and guidance on various aspects of life. Astrology is based on the belief that the positions of the planets and stars at the time of a person's birth can provide valuable information about their personality, strengths, weaknesses, and potential.

                                Astrology involves using a birth chart, which is a map of the positions of the planets and stars at the time of a person's birth, to gain insight into various aspects of their life. The birth chart can be used to identify patterns and tendencies in a person's personality, and to gain insight into their relationships, career, and personal growth.
                                
                                One of the great things about astrology is its versatility. Astrology can be used for a wide range of purposes, including gaining insight into relationships, career, and personal growth. It can also be used to identify patterns and obstacles that may be holding you back, and to gain clarity and direction in your life.
                                
                                Astrology can also be particularly useful for those who are seeking to connect with their inner wisdom and intuition. By using astrology to gain insight into your life, you can tap into your own intuition and inner wisdom, and gain a greater sense of clarity and purpose.
                                
                                Another benefit of astrology is its complexity. While astrology can be learned and used by anyone, it is a complex and multifaceted tool that can provide deep insights and guidance. Astrology can be used to gain a broad overview of a person's life path and potential, or to dive deep into specific areas of their life.
                                
                                Astrology is also a great way to connect with the energy and wisdom of the universe. By using astrology to gain insight into your life, you can tap into the energy of the universe and gain a deeper understanding of your place in it.
                                
                                In conclusion, astrology is a powerful and versatile tool for gaining insight and guidance on various aspects of life. Whether you're seeking clarity and direction in your life, looking to improve your relationships, or seeking to connect with your inner wisdom and intuition, astrology can provide you with the guidance and insight you need to grow and thrive. With its complexity, versatility, and deep connection to the forces of the universe, astrology is a valuable tool for anyone seeking to gain deeper understanding and clarity in their life.</p>

                            <p>Numerology is a fascinating practice that has been used for centuries to gain insight into the meaning of numbers and their relationship to our lives. It involves the use of numbers and their corresponding vibrations to provide insight and guidance on various aspects of life, including personality traits, life path, and relationships.

                                Numerology is based on the principle that everything in the universe is made up of energy, and that energy is expressed through numbers. Each number has its own unique vibration, and by understanding these vibrations, we can gain insight into the deeper meaning of numbers and their influence on our lives.
                                
                                In numerology, each letter of the alphabet is assigned a corresponding number, and these numbers are then used to create a numerology chart or reading. The chart or reading will provide insight into various aspects of your life, including your personality traits, strengths and weaknesses, life path, and relationships.

                            <p>Tarot card reading is a fascinating practice that has been around for centuries. It involves the use of a deck of cards that is rich in symbolism and meaning, and it is used to gain insight and guidance on various aspects of life. A tarot card reading can be an insightful and empowering experience that can help you gain a deeper understanding of yourself, your relationships, and your life path.

                                The tarot card deck consists of 78 cards, each with its own unique symbolism and meaning. There are two types of cards in the deck: the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana. The Major Arcana cards represent major life events and experiences, while the Minor Arcana cards represent more everyday aspects of life.
                                
                                During a tarot card reading, the reader will shuffle the cards and then lay them out in a specific pattern or spread. The layout of the cards will depend on the questions being asked and the type of reading being conducted. The reader will then interpret the cards, using their knowledge of tarot symbolism and intuition, to provide insight and guidance on the topic at hand.
                                
                                One of the great things about tarot card readings is that they can be used for a wide range of purposes. They can help you gain clarity on a specific situation or problem, provide guidance on your life path, give insight into your relationships, and much more. Some people also use tarot readings as a way to connect with their intuition and spiritual side.
                                
                                There are many benefits to getting a tarot card reading. First and foremost, a reading can provide you with a deeper understanding of yourself and your situation. It can help you see things from a different perspective and give you the insight you need to make positive changes in your life. Tarot readings can also help you connect with your inner wisdom and intuition, giving you the confidence you need to make decisions and take action.
                                
                                Another benefit of tarot card readings is that they can provide a sense of clarity and direction. If you are feeling lost or confused, a reading can help you see things more clearly and give you a sense of purpose and direction. It can also help you identify patterns and obstacles that may be holding you back, allowing you to make positive changes and move forward in your life.
                                
                                Tarot card readings can also be a source of comfort and support during difficult times. They can help you gain perspective and provide you with the guidance you need to navigate challenging situations. A reading can also be a way to connect with loved ones who have passed on, providing comfort and closure.
                                
                                In conclusion, a tarot card reading can be an incredibly empowering and insightful experience. Whether you are looking for guidance on a specific situation, seeking clarity and direction in your life, or simply wanting to connect with your intuition and spiritual side, a tarot reading can provide you with the insight and guidance you need. With its rich symbolism and deep meaning, tarot is a powerful tool for self-discovery and personal growth.</p>
